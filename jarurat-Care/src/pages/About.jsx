              <p>
                At <strong>Jaurat Care Foundation</strong>, we understand that
                facing cancer can be overwhelming, and no one should have to go
                through it alone. Our mission is to provide strength, care, and
                hope to those affected — ensuring no one faces this journey
                alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re a community-driven NGO working across India to empower
                patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals through
                education, awareness, and compassionate support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our focus is on creating a warm and inclusive space where
                everyone’s needs are heard and met — with volunteers, donors,
                and professionals joining hands to make a meaningful impact.
